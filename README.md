# Decentralized-Regional-Order-Manager

We created a decentralized Inventory manager for Regional stores to both track and manage their inventory.

1. The premise of the idea
⋅⋅* Regional managers can see the prices of different inventory in real-time. 
⋅⋅* Managers can order more inventory by connecting their metamask to the application and placing an order on the app. The order gets confirmed after 12 blocks.
